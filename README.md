# NYC taxi data from january, 2015

Dataset from __http://s3.amazonaws.com/datashader-data/nyc_taxi.zip__
Renamed columns, dropped dependent columns (pick and dropoff hours). Saved
in `parquet` format.

Some plots of data by days and hours, pick and dropoff locations on map.
Work in progress (maybe for workshop at PyCon SK 2024).

Modules needed: `marimo, plotly, polars`.
